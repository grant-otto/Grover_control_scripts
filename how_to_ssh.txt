How to ssh into this Pi:

make sure you are on Eduroam or using a VPN.
Ensure that the device is on the UD Devices network. It should be on there by default.

In the terminal run:

ssh pi@128.4.213.124
if in Lewes, try ssh pi@128.4.232.34
if none of this works, plug the pi into the monitor and do an ifconfig from the terminal there.

The IP address should not change.
The password is: team122
hello
